  In React, we store data separately from our components.
  This keeps things organized and makes data easy to reuse.
  We export the array so any component can import it.

  Each restaurant now includes:
    - healthierOption: a lower-calorie alternative from the same restaurant
    - healthierTip: advice on how to make the recommended meal even healthier
